            I was tasked with compiling the data and using local API's to gather the information on the different establishment's health scores. As mentioned below; some of the counties website did not lend themselves to scraping for data nor did any available API's exist to perform the task. There were a number of programs to use and most of them involved substantial financial commitments to use for more than the very useless trial period. I used ParseHub's model to scrub the remaining counties for the health score/address/name/zip code. As Lisa mentioned there was also the challenge of delegating tasks porportionately to allow each member to use the skills they have learned and showcase them to potential business relationships.

            My biggest challenge was determining how to break up the work three ways so everyone had a fair share of work to do and merge conflicts were minimized. Learning to find a git collaboration workflow was another big challenge. I'm not sure we arrived at the best way to handle merging but we managed to not lose any code and completed the project without too many headaches.

        I was in charge of handling all tasks concerning the front-end components of Mysophobia. Being that this was my first time in charge of design, I was fairly nervous. However, the tools in the bootstrap API helped make the process much more effcient and easy-going.
